# Wemos-D1-Mini-Trigboard

Kicad PCB Layout of an attempt to replicate the good work that Kevin Darrah (https://https://github.com/krdarrah) has done, but in the form factor of a Wemos D1 Mini

None of this has been tested, just an exercice in learning KiCad, and seeing if I could do it well enough.

As soon as Covid 19 dies down a bit, i will be ordering boards and parts.
